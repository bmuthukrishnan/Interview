1. how to make read only array list - Collecoions. unmodifiablelist
1.1 - bubble sort, fibonaci
2. End point in RESTful appi
3. difference between fecth and pull in git -  
	Fetch will get the updated details only
	Pull will get the full resource from repositary
4. reduse - elastice ***
5. Spring boot design paterns
6. SOLID principal
	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
7. Functional interfaces in java 8 - Predicate, consumer, suplier
8. swagger - documentation API. Interface decsription language for describing REST API 
9. joins in oracle
10. Spring security implimentation in jave spring boot
11. Final arraylist - can add data in the list and not able to modify the data in the list.
12. when ConcurrentModificationException exception java occured - modify the collection when some thread is iterating over it. during that time ConcurrentModificationException will occure
13. why function interface dont accept only one abstract method- because it is used in lmbda expression.
14. stream API - ******
15. difference between meta space and prime gen menory - meta space is introduced in java 8
16. design paterns - 
     Singletone 
	 prototype
	 factory -  hibernate (load)
	 bridge
17. Issues faces in previous projects **************
	Define requirement clearly. some un nexpected changes received after requirement discussion. last minit changes
	Integrating third-party or other custom applications
	adiquate testting is required before deployment.
	
18. challenges faced in previous project  ***********
	system security is one of the challenge. it is the responsibility of all stake holder not only software engineere.
	addopting new technologies is one of the challenges
	time limitation
	Data preparation 
	Unclear of requirements
19. REST API
20. Design ptern in hibernate
	Proxy patern - used fro lazy loading
	Factory patern - Session factory
21. Hibernate validator framework.
	Validator used in jave script for presentation layer before processing server side
	It is a cross cutting task so it should be keep away from busuiness logic.
22. First level and second level cache in hibernate
	first level - in session level. it is enabled by default. single threaded short living. thread safe
	second level - it is session factory level. buy default it is false. it needs to be enabled if required. imutable shared by all sessions. not thread safe
23. sorted and ordered collection in Hibernate
	sorted collection - by using collection.sort
	ordered collection - by using order by clause indatabase itself
24. difference between transient, persistant, ditached
	Tranient - New object created without interacting with hibernate session
	Persistant - Object associated with hibernate session. save, saveorupdate, persist
	detached - detached state with hibernate session. detach, close,
25. dirty check
	Dirty check is changes or update the field which requires action, rest of the fields are untuchable
26. Lazy loading - where the object are loaded as needed.
27. SEssionFactory = sessionfactory.configuration.configure.buildsessionfactory
	SEssion session = factory.openSession
	Transaction tx = session.beginTransactoin
28. Hibernate validator - @NotNull, @NotEmpty, @Null, @max(Value =), @min(Value=), @Size
	

REST API
@RestController
@RequestMapping
@RequestBody
@GetMapping
@PostMapping
@PutMapping
@PathVariable -> URI user/{id}
sql queries -> URL http://localhost:app/user?=muthu
Spring mvc ->
			Request -> DispatcherServlet ->
											-> HandlerMapping
											-> Controller <-> Model and View
											-> ViewResolver
											-> View
Spring Batch
Job Scgeduler -> Job Launcher -> Job -> steps 
										-> ItemReader
										-> ItemProcesser
										-> ItemWriter
Launcher - > Configuring class -> (FeedFile Generation)
								Reader - from data base base on mapping
								Processor - Processing the data and manupulate and update if required
								Writer - Write the date in to database
Spring boot
@SpringBootApplication - > @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan
