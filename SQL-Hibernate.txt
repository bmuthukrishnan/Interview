SELECT e.employeeid, e.salary FROM employee e
WHERE 5 - 1 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM employee e1 
WHERE e.salary > e1.salary;

wright query for employee and depertment inner join primary key.

joins in oracle - inner join, left outer join, right outer join, full outer join

select * from (select e.employeeid, e.firstname, e.lastname, e.salary, dense_rank() 
over (order by e.salary asc) as rankval from employee e)emp where rankval = 8

9.1 Query to find 6th highest salary in the employee.

Hibernate:

20. Design patern in hibernate
	Proxy patern - used fro lazy loading
	Factory patern - Session factory
21. Hibernate validator framework.
	Validator used in jave script for presentation layer before processing server side
	It is a cross cutting task so it should be keep away from busuiness logic.
22. First level and second level cache in hibernate
	first level - in session level. it is enabled by default. single threaded short living. thread safe
	second level - it is session factory level. buy default it is false. it needs to be enabled if required. 
	imutable shared by all sessions. not thread safe
23. sorted and ordered collection in Hibernate
	sorted collection - by using collection.sort
	ordered collection - by using order by clause in database itself
24. difference between transient, persistant, ditached
	Tranient - New object created without interacting with hibernate session
	Persistant - Object associated with hibernate session. save, saveorupdate, persist
	detached - detached state with hibernate session. detach, close,
25. dirty check
	Dirty check is changes or update the field which requires action, rest of the fields are untuchable
26. Lazy loading - where the object are loaded as needed.
27. SEssionFactory = sessionfactory.configuration.configure.buildsessionfactory
	SEssion session = factory.openSession
	Transaction tx = session.beginTransactoin
28. Hibernate validator - @NotNull, @NotEmpty, @Null, @max(Value =), @min(Value=), @Size
16. design paterns - 
     Singletone - used for datebase connection, file close
	 prototype 
	 proxy -  hibernate (lazy load)
	 factory - SessionFactory
